# Square Encryption 

This Java program implements encoding and decoding of text using the Playfair cipher. It encodes and decodes letter pairs according to the following rules:

- **Encoding**: Handles pairs in the same row, column, or rectangle, and adds an 'X' between identical letters.
- **Decoding**: Reverses the encoding process and removes unwanted 'X' characters when necessary.
- **Key Change**: Supports the option to change the cipher key for encoding and decoding.
